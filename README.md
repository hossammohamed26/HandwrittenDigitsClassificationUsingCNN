# Handwritten Digits Classification Using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

This repository contains an implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm for classifying handwritten digits. The algorithm is built using Python and utilizes the Keras library with TensorFlow as the backend.

## Dataset

The algorithm uses the popular MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0-9). The dataset is included in the repository under the `data` directory.

## Usage

To use the Handwritten Digits Classification Using CNN algorithm, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/hossammohamed26/HandwrittenDigitsClassificationUsingCNN
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred Python IDE or editor.

3. Install the required dependencies. You can use pip to install the necessary packages:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the `handwritten_digits_cnn.py` script.

   ```
   python Ml-3.py
   ```

5. The algorithm will train the four CNN models using the MNIST dataset and evaluate its performance on the test set.
